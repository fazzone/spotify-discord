* spotify player discord bot
** spotify interaction
   librespot: [[https://github.com/plietar/librespot]]
   - can we use spotify connect somehow?
** discord interaction
   discord.rs: [[https://github.com/SpaceManiac/discord-rs]]

* WHY RUST?
I decided to use Rust for this project because I basically
need to use those two libraries and they are both written in
Rust.  There are python libraries for the Discord API, but as
far as I know librespot is the only library that can actually
download songs from Spotify.  

* FEEDBACK REQUESTED
- levels good? 
- how do you feel about the key display at the top?

* RUST QUESTIONS (can you help?)
- should I commit Cargo.lock?
- why can't I use the ? macro?
- how can I not use unwrap() everywhere?
** TOKIO QUESTIONS
   - should there only ever be one Core?
   - how bad should I feel for creating a core per request?
** SERDE QUESTIONS
   - how can I implement custom JSON (de)serialize?
   - I need a JSON field called 'type' which is a rust keyword
*** Or do I...will Spotify accept 'Type'?

* MVP: `!play`o
** monitor server general chat using discord api
** given the search string, get audio from spotify
   we will need a librespot client program which can:
   - perform a search
     - librespot doesn't seem to do this,
     - so we will need to use the regular spotify REST api
   - extract the id of the first track in the search results
   - return audio data
     - get 16-bit pcm from librespot?
** transcode/send       
   should be handled by discord.rs

* CURRENTLY WORKING ON:
** DONE set up cargo project with our deps
** TODO write spotify search program
*** DONE set up spotify API
**** DONE get api key
**** DONE load api secrets from config file 
*** TODO make request (search tracks)
**** DONE figure out how to authenticate with spotify
**** DONE *CURRENT* create and send search request
*** DONE parse response (extract track ID)
**** DONE how to parse unstructured json
